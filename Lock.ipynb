    "**Race condition** is a significant problem in concurrent programming. The condition occurs when one thread tries to modify a shared resource at the same time that another thread is modifying that resource – t​his leads to garbled output, which is why threads need to be synchronized.\n",

    "The threading module of Python includes **locks** as a synchronization tool. A lock has two states:\n",

    "Suppose that there are 100 dollars in a bank account. Every month, 10 dollars are deposited as profit, and 10 dollars are deducted to pay a bill. **thread1** deposits the profit and **thread2** pays for the bill. In some months, the profit is deposited after the bill is paid. However, this should not affect the final amount in the account.\n",
